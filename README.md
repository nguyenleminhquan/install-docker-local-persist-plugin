### Attention: must run scripts with root permission.
---
I created this repo for installing the dokcer-volume-local-persist plugin, which is based on [local-persist](https://github.com/MatchbookLab/local-persist).
Currently, I encounter the problem when using its quick way to install plugins.

So I write sample scripts with manual steps to install plugins.

I hope you enjoy it!
